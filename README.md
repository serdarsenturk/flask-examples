# Flask examples
In this repository contains two flask examples. Descreption in blow.  

#### Flask-Hello-World Example
```sh
This example`s targets implemantation of basic api feature.Once i created two form which contact_get and contact_post. In 'hello.py' i define two route for these forms. When user fill the form which selected by user, 'hello.py' return this value to user.  
```
#### Flask-Api-Project
```sh
In this example, there are dummy data recorded in the database. If the user enters one of the url defined on localhost, this data in the database will give the user a json type result with the help of HTTP methods. If the user wants to add a product himself, he will be able to add it to the database by entering appropriate data in json type. In this example, both RESTFUL API and database are used effectively.
```

I used Postman API client to use see request and respons properties.I added these screenshots in Flask-Exercises-cookies.
